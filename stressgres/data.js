          "message": "chore: more improvements to index/schema configuration and management (#2771)\n\n## What\n\n#2660 brought a much needed round of cleanups to how we manage index\nschemas. Unfortunately, it introduced quite some overhead in\nreading/decoding/validating the schema. This process was happening quite\na bit throughout the execution paths of `aminsert` and other hot-spots.\n\n#2176 brought the ability to essentially keep one heavy-weight\n`PgSearchRelation` instantiated and cheaply clone it when necessary.\nThis PR cleans up things further such that the `SearchIndexSchema` is\nnow a lazily-evaluated property of `PgSearchRelation`. This means\n`SearchIndexSchema` is only evaluated when needed, and then only once\n(at least per statement).\n\nFurthermore, its internal properties are lazily-evaluated, ensuring any\ngiven code path doesn't do more work than it needs.\n\nThis also renames `SearchIndexOptions` to `BM25IndexOptions`, mainly\nbecause I kept getting confused about what `SearchIndexOptions`\nrepresented (it was too similarly named to `SearchIndexSchema` for my\ntastes). And `BM25IndexOptions` is now a property of `PgSearchRelation`\ntoo.\n\nThis seems to have drastically improved the write throughput of the\nINSERT/UPDATE jobs in our `single-server.toml` stressgress test.\nv0.15.26 was 176/s INSERTs and 154/s UPDATEs. This PR clocks in at 275/s\nand 260/s, respectively.\n\n# Other Notable Changes\n\n- Index configuration validation now happens during CREATE INDEX/REINDEX\nin `ambuildempty()` rather than on every instantiation of\n`SearchIndexSchema`.\n\n- The \"raw\" tokenizer deprecation warnings are now gone, unless somehow\nthe \"key_field\" is configured with it -- which is no longer possible\n\n## Why\n\nTrying to rollback performance regressions that were introduced in\n0.16.0\n\n## How\n\n## Tests\n\nAll existing tests pass, and a few were updated due to the \"raw\"\ntokenizer deprecation warning going away and a change in wording for a\nspecific validation error.",
